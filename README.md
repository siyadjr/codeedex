Codeedex Flutter Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Codeedex Flutter technical assignment.

Due to time constraints (4 hours) and performance limitations of my system (PC lag), I was able to complete 2 core screens:

✅ Login Screen

✅ Home Screen

🧩 Implementation Notes

I focused on stability over quantity to avoid broken or incomplete screens.

To save time and maintain consistency:

Reused widgets wherever possible

Used the same API data across sections to complete the UI efficiently

Refactored code early so additional screens could be added easily later

The remaining screens follow a similar pattern and can be implemented quickly using the existing structure.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Packages Used

State Management: Provider
fonts :'Lufga'
Networking: Dio

Local Storage: SharedPreferences (for storing auth token)

Loading UI: Shimmer (better user experience during API calls)

🎨 UI & Assets

UI is implemented based on the provided Figma designs

Static images from Figma are used as fallbacks in case of missing or failed network images

⚙️ Environment

Flutter version: 3.32.3
Dart version: 3.8.1

The SDK was not upgraded as I have been working on a company laptop for the past 4–5 months where this setup was already stable.

✅ Summary

Although only two screens were completed within the given time, the project structure is:

Clean, Modular , Scalable

Easy to extend with additional screens and features

I prioritized code quality, reusability, and a smooth user experience within the limited time available.
